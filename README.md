## InventoryApp
*January, 2022.*

This is a five member team project and the idea was to create an Android application to track inventory of an office or some other kind of business space. The registered user can see the available resources and borrow them, and then return them. The application allows the user to scan the NFC resource label and then guide it to its details. Also, the user can select the AR option that will take him to the place where the desired resource is located.

Application prototype with all the functionalities of the application: [FIGMA](https://www.figma.com/file/tejK8Fu0GU04rwx4zI5166/InventoryApp?node-id=1959%3A6020)

Used technologies:
* The frontend part of the app uses Unity and Flutter, and
* the backend part of the app uses Azure Spatial Anchor and Strapi.
